# Helper Buddies

A light Fabric mod for **Minecraft 1.20.1**, built to drop into the **Prominence II: Hasturian Era**
modpack, though it works with any Fabric 1.20.1 setup that has Fabric API.

Every player on the world can summon their own little helper and tell it what to collect. The helper
works out the best way to get it:

- It searches nearby for the closest blocks that give you that material. It knows about deepslate and
  modded variants.
- It walks there if it can. If not, it digs a staircase or tunnel, bridges gaps or pillars up.
- It picks the best tool from its inventory for every block: the fastest one, fortune for ores, never
  silk touch unless that's what you want.
- It mines out the whole vein or tree before moving on.
- It brings everything back to you when it's done or its pockets are full.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/helper summon` | Summon your helper next to you |
| `/helper collect <material> [amount]` | Go get something, e.g. `/helper collect iron 32` (default amount 64) |
| `/helper deliver` | Bring me what you have right now, then keep going |
| `/helper stop` | Stop the current job and follow me |
| `/helper status` | What are you doing, and what are you carrying? |
| `/helper dismiss` | Send your helper away. It keeps your items for next time |

**Right-click your helper** to open its inventory. Put tools in there (pickaxe, axe, shovel) and take out
anything you like. Helpers won't use a tool that's about to break, so you won't lose your gear.

### Material examples

`iron`, `gold`, `copper`, `coal`, `diamond`, `emerald`, `lapis`, `redstone`, `quartz`, `netherite`
(ancient debris), `wood` (any logs), `oak_log`, `stone`, `cobblestone`, `dirt`, `sand`, `gravel`, `flint`,
`clay_ball`, `obsidian`, `amethyst_shard`... Modded items work too, e.g. `raw_tin` or `create:zinc_ore`.
Block tags work with `#`, e.g. `#minecraft:logs`.

## Safety on shared worlds

- Helpers only break **natural** blocks: stone, dirt, ores, real trees (logs with natural leaves next to
  them), and so on. They refuse to collect crafted blocks like planks, and they never tunnel through anything
  a player placed (cobblestone, planks, chests, ...).
- They avoid lava, won't drop down big holes, and plug the top of any mineshaft they dig.
- Helpers can't be hurt and never despawn. Their inventory is saved with the world, so nothing is lost if
  one gets unloaded.
- Only the owner can open a helper's inventory.
- Helpers do **not** check land-claim mods, so ask players to keep their helpers away from other people's
  bases.

## Installing (CurseForge / Prominence II)

1. In CurseForge, open the Prominence II instance, click the **⋮** menu → **Open Folder**.
2. Put `helper-mod-1.0.0.jar` into the `mods` folder.
3. Launch the game.

**Playing together:**
- **Open to LAN, or the host's single-player world:** only the host needs the mod.
- **Dedicated server:** put the jar in the server's `mods` folder. Players joining don't need it.

## Building from source

Requires Java 17 or newer.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The mod jar ends up in `build/libs/`.

## Notes

- A helper looks like a wandering trader with a name tag ("Jordan's Helper"). It's a vanilla mob, which is
  why nobody else has to install anything.
- Helpers only work while they're within simulation distance of their owner. If you walk or teleport far
  away, your helper pops back next to you and starts searching again from there.
- Mining speed follows the normal player rules. Better tools and Efficiency make your helper faster.
